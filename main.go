Introduction
To write the application you can use any language. It should work as a web server. You can post it as a gist, upload to github or send us via email, anything works as long as the code is correct and you send us instructions how to use it.

Background
In any hotels site like Kaligo.com operated by Ascenda, there's a lot of effort being made to present content in a clean & organised manner. Underneath the hood however, the data procurement process is complex and data is often mismatched & dirty.

This exercise gives you a sneak peak in some of the actions we take to clean up data before it makes it to the site

we are querying multiple suppliers to assimilate data for these different sources
we are building the most complete data set possible
we are sanitizing them to remove any dirty data
etc.
The task is to write a simplified version of our data procurement & merging proceess.

It needs to work in the following way:

Requirements
Merge hotel data of different suppliers
Parse and clean dirty data
Select what you think is the best data to deliver using some simple rules
Deliver it via an API endpoint by you which allows us to query the hotels data with some simple filtering
The below states the system input and output requirements. We're also evaluating how you deal with the different types & nuances of source data.

Request
Endpoint needs to accept following parameters: destination, hotels
When requested, the server needs to fetch the results filtered in either option:
hotels: based on a list of hotel IDs given
destination: based on a given destination ID
Each hotel should be returned only once (since you've already uniquely merged the data)
Caveats
In this exercise, we assume the following:

Matching of IDs are clean & sanitized
All supplier endpoints given have the same matching hotel & destination IDs
You can merge them based off these IDs
Image links from the suppliers are already verified as working, you only need to worry about the organization of image data for it
No data-analytics approach is needed for this exercise, we're not looking for any fancy machine-learning evaluation for merging the data, some simple rules in code for matching the data is sufficient.
Response
Response should be returned in an organised format. An example is shown below.
If you elect to modify the response format, do specify why you think your elected choice is better.
[Bonus] Any performance decisions can you make for this process. There's actually 2 parts here
Procuring the data
Delivering the data

Resources:
There are 3 suppliers, each of them has different url:
- http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ebbea002e000054009f3ffc
- http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ebbea102e000029009f3fff
- http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ebbea1f2e00002b009f4000
Please note that for the simplification and ease of testing these are static urls, they always return the same values, but you shouldn't treat them as static content (e.g. your information procurement should react dynamically over time if I decide to add/ remove a hotel from 1 of the supplier datasets)
